# Implementation-of-a-Fully-automated-Optimized-Fog-computing-based-IoT-controlled-PV-Network
This repo contains the codes used in the process of making the conference paper with the title "Implementation of a Fully-automated Optimized Fog-computing-based IoT-controlled PV Network"

The repo content is as follows:

1. A PDF file that documents all of the codes in one location under "Codes in PDF".
2. The gateway code under "gateway.py"
3. The sensor nodes' codes under "node1&node2.ino".
4. The actuator node code under "actuator_node.ino".
5. The load swapping algorithm code of the fog node under "load_swapping.py".
